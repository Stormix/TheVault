# The Vault

Still a WIP since I need to migrate all my notes from OneNote.


## Note
- I just start using Obsidian recently, so I don't have a lot of notes and the structure will definitely change.
- The repo is updated automatically by the obsidian-git plugin, so the commits won't be that meaningfull.


## To Do:
- Reorganize notes  (The [P.A.R.A. method](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/) looks interesting)
- Publish vault as a publicly available website (using [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) maybe?)
