## Question:  Create a shell script that displays the ids of the last 5 scripts

- Create a shell script = "make a file called whatever.sh and put some code inside of it to do stuff" 

- The `sh` extension is short for `shell`
- so a shell script is a file with an extension `.sh


```
touch git_commit.sh
```


```
sh git_commit.sh
bash git_commit.sh
```

```
chmod +x git_commit.sh
```
